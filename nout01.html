        <h3>T-Hub Visit</h3>
        <h4>Review:</h4>
        <p>During our second year of degree, our college organized an industrial visit to T-Hub, Hyderabad, which is one of India’s leading innovation
        and startup ecosystems. During the visit, we attended an informative seminar that explained the importance of T-Hub and its role in promoting 
        innovation, entrepreneurship, and startup culture among students and young professionals.<br>

        The session focused on how T-Hub supports individuals in developing startup ideas, pitching concepts, mentoring, funding opportunities, 
        and industry networking.<br>

        The Vice President of T-Hub, Mr. Srinivas Rao Mahankali, along with the senior management team, addressed the students and shared valuable insights 
        on entrepreneurship, idea validation, and startup growth. The Director and Vice President explained the vision of T-Hub and highlighted its world-class infrastructure, 
          collaborative workspaces, incubation facilities, and support systems designed to nurture innovative ideas.<br>
        The visit was highly motivating and gave us a clear understanding of how T-Hub helps students and aspiring entrepreneurs transform ideas into successful startups.</p>

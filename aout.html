    <h3>Coca-Cola Factory</h3>
    <h4>Review:</h4>

    <p>
      We had an insightful and memorable visit to the Coca-Cola factory, where we were given a complete guided tour of the facility.
      The entire production process is highly advanced and fully operated using modern machinery, ensuring efficiency, consistency,
      and quality at every stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the factory round, we observed how the manufacturing process is organized into different levels, each with a specific function.
      From raw material handling and mixing to bottling, labeling, and packaging, every stage is carefully monitored and controlled.
      Automated machines handle most of the work, reducing manual intervention and maintaining high standards of hygiene and safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      The staff explained how quality checks are carried out at multiple levels to ensure that every bottle meets Coca-Cola’s global standards.
      The smooth coordination between machines and skilled operators demonstrated how technology and teamwork work together to deliver
      a trusted product to consumers.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the beginning of the visit, we were warmly welcomed by the factory team and were offered refreshing welcome drinks,
      which added a pleasant touch to the experience. Overall, the visit provided valuable insight into large-scale beverage
      manufacturing and showcased Coca-Cola’s commitment to innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction.
